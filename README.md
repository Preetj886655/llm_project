# 🤖 LLM Project using Transformer & Attention Mechanisms (GPT-2, PyTorch)

This project demonstrates the power of **Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs)** using the **GPT-2** architecture, implemented in **PyTorch** and run on **Google Colab**.

It explores core NLP tasks such as:
- 📝 Text Generation
- 📚 Text Summarization
- 🧠 Text Classification
- ❓ Question Answering

All powered by the **attention mechanism** at the heart of modern LLMs.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Understand and visualize the **attention mechanism** in GPT-based models.
- Build a flexible, Colab-ready NLP workflow using PyTorch and Hugging Face.
- Apply the model to real-world tasks such as:
  - Text generation with custom prompts
  - Summarization of large paragraphs
  - Simple text classification tasks
  - Interactive question answering
